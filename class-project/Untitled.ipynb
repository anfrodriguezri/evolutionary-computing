      " The bathroom containing the toilet and the shower was also very small, not to mention the sink and counter directly outside of it .\n",
      " Turning the bathroom light on also turns the counter light on, meaning a middle, of, the, night trip to the bathroom means the whole side of the room gets illuminated  and the wooden shutters that were installed in place of traditional curtains to add to the hotel's theme do absolutely nothing to keep the room dark once the sun comes up .\n",
